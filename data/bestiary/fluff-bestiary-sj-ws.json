				"Though beholders are exceptionally intelligent, they have found little success in learning magic. Most have contented themselves with the natural abilities of the eye tyrant.",
				"Why can’t beholders manipulate the magic that flows so freely through their bodies? The reason is their central eye, that produces the anti-magic ray. Its energies effectively “short circuit” the creature’s magical potential.",
				"A beholder can learn magic if its central eye does not function. The first beholder magi were born blind in this eye and learned magic to compensate. Others ruthlessly put out their own eyes, though these fanatics are nearly always outcast from all beholder nations."

				"An artificial life form created by the mysterious Arcane, this oozing slime maintains the Hive. Its extraordinary three-phase life cycle serves different functions within the asteroid complex. These three phases are as follows:",
				"{@i Amoebas:} In its basic form, the silver slime is a colony of 10-20,000 inch-long blobs, each weighing about one ounce. These bright silver blobs, or amoebas, scavenge the area in a 1,000' radius, eating all organic waste and small mineral particles. The small slimes can be destroyed easily and represent no harm to anything larger than a sand particle. This cleaning phase lasts for one week or until the area is clean, whichever is longer.",
				"{@i Plasmodium (slug):} Once the cleaning phase ends, the colony of small slimes draws together over a period of two days, gradually growing into a single large blob, coloured dull silver and weighing 500-800 lbs. This slug-like aggregate, called a \"plasmodium,\" crawls around within an area of one square mile for one week, fixing leaks and repairing breaks.",
				"The plasmodium has the magical ability to form repair tools from its silvery bulk. When it encounters a crack in some object, the creature extends a pseudopod. The pseudopod transforms into the tool needed to fix the crack.",
				"For metal cracks, the pseudopod becomes a welding torch: a flaming wand that burns hot enough to melt and seal metal. For cracks in stone, the pseudopod turns into a trowel, and brushes part of its own substance onto the crack. The slimy material dries hard, sealing the crack. Once the task is complete, the plasmodium reabsorbs the tool.",
				"{@i Sporangia (fruiting bulbs):} After one week, or when it has used half of its substance sealing cracks, the plasmodium halts and extrudes a central stalk. The stalk is a light, wood-like substance similar to cork. The slime colony climbs the stalk, extending it and branching as the climb continues, until the stalk resembles a stately tree 20 feet tall. The slime colony becomes 100-400 silvery spheres about 1'' in diameter, each hanging from the end of a branch. Each sphere is called a \"sporangium.\"",
				"For one week, the immobile colony photosynthesises, taking in carbon dioxide and exhaling oxygen and so refreshing the asteroids air. Then the papery sporangia burst, expelling a cloud of spores 18' in diameter. The cloud dissipates in two rounds, and the spores drift on air currents to new locations. There they land, turn into amoebas, and the life cycle begins again."
